*:Snake*

Opens a new tab with the game running. Use `hjkl` or the arrow keys to direct
the snake.

The game objective is to eat little pellets as they appear on the board
without running into yourself or the walls. There's no way to stop, and you
gain size with every pellet you eat.

It's a weird game.

The render loop uses async jobs, which is an unsupported feature on vim 7.x or
earlier.

This program is developed and tested regularly in neovim, and occasionally I
try it with vim 8.
